I'm 23 and a freshman at [Mizzou](https://missouri.edu/). Although I have taken other classes from other colleges so I am more so near a Senior level

My favorite food is teriyaki chicken, from Kitaros.

I spend a lot of time on my pc. I do things such as my school work, game with friends, or other things such as coding.

I have taken several other classes before this is not my first.

Before this job I had wished to be a pilot.
